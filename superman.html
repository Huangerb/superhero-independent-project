    <p id="superintro">
    Superman, also known as the Man of Steel, is one of the most powerful superheroes in the DC Universe. His abilities include super-strength, super-speed, invulnerability, freeze breath, flight, and heat-vision. Born as Kal-El on the dying planet Krypton, his parents Jor-El and Lara sent him in a rocket to the planet Earth where he would be the last surviving member of his race. His rocket was discovered by the Jonathan and Martha Kent, who raised him as their son Clark Kent in the town of Smallville, Kansas.

    <p id="superrelations">
    His upbringing provided him with strong moral values, and life-long friends like Lana Lang and Pete Ross. His secret identity is a reporter at the Daily Planet in the city of Metropolis. This is where he interacts with his love interest Lois Lane, and his co-workers Perry White and Jimmy Olsen. His greatest nemesis is the brilliant super-villain Lex Luthor.

    <p id="supervirtues">
    To preserve the memory of his home planet and provide him rest from his double-life and adventures, he maintains a Fortress of Solitude at the North Pole. Superman remains proud of his dual heritage, taking seriously the lessons of his birth-parents and his adopted parents. Although he is an alien to this world, he heavily values his humanity, and fights with conviction for truth, justice, and the American way. There are several other heroes inspired by or directly related to his legacy, including Superboy and Supergirl. He is also a member of the Justice League of America and the Legion of Super-Heroes.

    <p id="supercomics">
    Superman was created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster in 1938, first appearing in Action Comics #1. His supporting cast and his villains have had a lengthy publication history, making him one of the three most important characters at DC Comics including Batman and Wonder Woman.

        <h2 class="justiceleague" id="jusleague">Justice League</h2><p><a href="#supertitle">[back to top]</a></p>
        
      <p class="justiceleague">Superman's first meeting with another superhero is with Batman in Gotham City. He tries to arrest Batman at first, but when he is unable, they team up despite their differences to end a trail of murders committed by Magpie. This first meeting would later be changed by Infinite Crisis into a conflict on a cruise ship involving the Crime Syndicate, Deathstroke and Mister Mxyzptlk.</p>
      <p class="justiceleague">The <abbr title="Justice League of America">JLA</abbr> was formed by Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, The Flash, Green Lantern, Aquaman, and Martian Manhunter after Applaxians attacked Earth. Superman became one of the first members of the team, along with Batman and Wonder Woman, after the team was first formed.</p>

    <h3 id="kryptphy">Kryptonian Physiology</h3><p><a href="#supertitle">[back to top]</a></p>
    
    <p>Superman's cellular structure is much more dense, resilient, and biologically more effective than human tissue. As an alien, he possesses several organs whose functions are not yet disclosed or understood, but are believed to be part of or the source of his bio-matrix force field and reclamation aura. Superman's body also stores energy actively within his bio-cellular matrix as an energy pattern that is linked to his body's electromagnetic field. This energy powers most of his electromagnetic capabilities such as flight, heat vision and other "sight"-based abilities while supplementing his physical abilities to superhuman levels.</p>
    
    <h3 id="solradabs">Solar Radiation Absorbtion</h3><p><a href="#supertitle">[back to top]</a></p>
    
    <p>As a Kryptonian, his cells function like a super battery, hyper metabolizing specific wavelengths of radiation as fuel to enable living functions and/or superhuman abilities. Different wavelengths of radiation have different effects on Superman's physiology and well being, but his cells cannot absorb or utilize all types of radiation. Every time Superman uses any of his superhuman abilities, his body expends absorbed sunlight and he is capable utilizing any of them to various degrees through controlled circumstances. The solar-based radiation of a foreign blue star proved to increase his known abilities under a yellow sun to a higher degree and enabled additional powers. The existence and constant exposure to proven "healthy" radiation sources is not required for him to live and utilize his powers, but prolonged periods without exposure to them and/or utilizing his powers will require him to recharge in order to live and continue using his powers.</p>

    <h3 id="superhumstrenth">Superhuman Strength</h3><p><a href="#supertitle">[back to top]</a></p>
    
    <p>The exact limits of Superman's strength is unknown, but he is capable lifting far in excess of 100 tons. Different periods and intensities of exposure to Earth's solar radiation can cause his strength to fluctuate over time. Superman's known feats include lifting an enormous pyramid and flying it to Mars without any strain, physically defeating Darkseid in combat, moving Earth away from the Sun while Starbreaker was pushing it toward the Sun, and having the strength necessary to shatter small planets</p>

    <h3 id="invul">Invulnerability</h3><p><a href="#supertitle">[back to top]</a></p>
    
    <p>Superman's body is invulnerable due to his superhumanly dense cellular and anatomical structure as well as his radiating bio-electrical aura. Superman is under some circumstances resistant or immune to different forms and levels of lacerations, blunt force trauma, energy-based assaults, falls from great heights, explosions, the cold void of space, toxins and all known diseases on Earth.</p>

    <h3 id="flight">Flight</h3><p><a href="#supertitle">[back to top]</a></p>
    
    <p>Superman is capable of flying at supersonic speeds (over two thousand miles per second[453]) in a planetary atmosphere and at faster-than-light speeds while in space.</p>
    <br>
    <h3 id="superspeed">Superhuman Speed</h3><p><a href="#supertitle">[back to top]</a></p>
    
    <p>Superman is capable of moving, reacting, running and flying at superhuman speeds. While not as fast as the Flash on a planet, Superman can fly at speeds faster than light and is considered one of the fastest beings in the universe.</p>
    
     
    <h3 id="supersense">Superhuman Senses</h3><p><a href="#supertitle">[back to top]</a></p>
 
    <p>Superman has incredible hearing at extreme variances of sound and pitch frequency, allowing him to pick up noises from across the globe. He has shown enough control to block out ambient sounds to focus on a specific source/frequency. On various occasions, Superman has demonstrated that his sense of smell is significantly enhanced to the point he can smell odors across the entire planet. Superman also possesses a superior sensory arrangement of visual capabilities.</p>

    <h3 id="heatvis">Heat Vision</h3><p><a href="#supertitle">[back to top]</a></p>
    
    <p>Superman can fire beams of intense heat from his eyes. These beams can be made invisible, allowing him to work undetected, and can be adjusted to affect matter on a microscopic level.</p>
